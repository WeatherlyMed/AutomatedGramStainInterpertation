A Raspberry Pi was be connected to a DRV8825 Motor Controller and Nema 17 stepper motors for automated collection of data and scanning of the slide. The stepper motors were connected to the knobs of the microscopeâ€™s slide holder using 3D printed parts in order to automatically move the slide beneath the microscope. The Raspberry Pi was able to take and upload photographs from the Hitachi KP-D20BU to a SSD for later use.
